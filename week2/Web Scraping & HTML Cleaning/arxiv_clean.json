    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Where to show Demos in Your Prompt: A Positional Bias of In-Context Learning\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time: we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks. We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position. Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN, LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast, placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\\% of predictions without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on complex tasks.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Kwesi Adu Cobbina [view email]**[v1]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 17:59:46 UTC (9,561 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "title": "RecGPT Technical Report",
    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Information Retrieval\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:RecGPT Technical Report\n\nView PDFAbstract:Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants, and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e., optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent. This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem.\n\nTo address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App. Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions. These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually beneficial recommendation ecosystem.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Numerous outages occur each year, exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events. However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology, GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from 2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power outages.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.IR\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Focusing on psychology as a prominent case, this study explores the interdisciplinary synergy between AI and the field by analyzing 1,006 LLM-related papers published in premier AI venues between 2023 and 2025, along with the 2,544 psychology publications they cite. Through our analysis, we identify key patterns of interdisciplinary integration, locate the psychology domains most frequently referenced, and highlight areas that remain underexplored. We further examine how psychology theories/frameworks are operationalized and interpreted, identify common types of misapplication, and offer guidance for more effective incorporation.

However, NL plans are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions. Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment, addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit scoring.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Our dataset consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia, created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover, apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for open-ended question answering.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Sound\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Next Tokens Denoising for Speech Synthesis\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Reducing Hallucinations in Summarization via Reinforcement Learning with Entity Hallucination Index\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline, facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Praveenkumar Katwe [view email]**[v1]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 15:00:00 UTC (673 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Their token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However, pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information. Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering, classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and (iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically generated positive pairs.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, they often generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as 'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, most rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality. This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks.

To ensure holistic and fair evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores ``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \\textit{three} modalities (video, audio, and text), \\textit{six} responses per candidate, and \\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview performance assessment.

While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings. Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.\n\nIn this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative ideological positions across multiple languages.

We analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of linguistic proximity.\n\nThrough language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing, translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness. We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream performance and reveal internal \"fallback\" mechanisms for language selection when neurons are progressively deactivated.

Recent research efforts have progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

In particular, LLM performance in Arabic lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps. In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Raghad Al-Rasheed [view email]**[v1]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 12:16:39 UTC (8,910 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Unveiling the Influence of Amplifying Language-Specific Neurons\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them. However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge (Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Machine Learning\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Efficient Differentially Private Fine-Tuning of LLMs via Reinforcement Learning\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise, degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same ($\\epsilon$, $\\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Afshin Khadangi [view email]**[v1]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:46:53 UTC (32,990 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Exploiting Synergistic Cognitive Biases to Bypass Safety in LLMs\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models. CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety, paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:ControlMed: Adding Reasoning Control to Medical Language Model\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support. Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction dataset covering both \\textit{direct} and \\textit{reasoning responses}; 2) supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Despite its importance, selecting an optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

The emergence of Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However, domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios. We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11 lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly available at this https URL.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Long Nguyen Song Thien [view email]**[v1]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:14:31 UTC (1,752 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, their implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph. This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation. We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol, which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert oncologists.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

In contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\\% execution accuracy (EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\\% EX.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:IFEvalCode: Controlled Code Generation\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code; however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints, beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics: correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus code that precisely follows instructions.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an \"abstract reasoner\", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Unlike earlier Falcon models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1 is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024. These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks, instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license, underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

To find out, we generated 11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt \"Write a 1500 word potential {demonym} story\" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events. Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jill Walker Rettberg [view email]**[v1]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 07:44:28 UTC (2,150 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

It evaluates the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we introduce a novel benchmark, \\textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance. Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them.

This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations, and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks. We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone. Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific baselines.

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called \\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs \\textit{\\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a \\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality. Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e., approximately a 45\\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority, ranking first in the Personality Assessment track.

Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination, black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm, LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently, and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria: dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit ''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high consistency (robustness).\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Although dense neural models learn contextualised embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions; (2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However, traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system performance improvement.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Galo Castillo-López [view email]**[v1]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 23:48:41 UTC (695 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This study investigates whether the internal representations in Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience. We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions (Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of $5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, existing agent designs fail to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld, PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent paradigms in planning and exploration.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

We propose Reinforcement Learning from Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance, promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher, mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement. On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy) and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jude Dongyub Lee [view email]**[v1]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 20:35:35 UTC (7,798 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Recent studies have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC) estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens. Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using first-token approximations of contextual entropy.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Andrea Fronzetti Colladon PhD [view email]**[v1]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:58:41 UTC (822 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\nChange to browse by:\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Explainability Through Systematicity: The Hard Systematicity Challenge for Artificial Intelligence\n\nView PDFAbstract:This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI). Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the \"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed \"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking about \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational, authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity challenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic we need AI models to be and when.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale, accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and release all code and data to support future research.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Persona-Augmented Benchmarking: Evaluating LLMs Across Diverse Writing Styles\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs, which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance when faced with \"non-standard\" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation. Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Cryptography and Security\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Strategic Deflection: Defending LLMs from Logit Manipulation\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas, ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced threats.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement. Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the output quality of each model.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Genta Indra Winata [view email]**[v1]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:46:25 UTC (274 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Automated Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization, ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., \"curse of multilinguality\" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity, transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability over conventional RAG approaches.

However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive environment to measure and advance this critical capability.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a \"Simple Thinking\" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Shuquan Lian [view email]**[v1]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:22:07 UTC (2,092 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 12:17:53 UTC (2,111 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

In this work, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli, using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

We present Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization, similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally curated rewards.\n\nRLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates -- restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and multiple-choice question answering.\n\nBy turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025 (v1), last revised 30 Jul 2025 (this version, v2)]\n\n# Title:Training language models to be warm and empathetic makes them less reliable and more sycophantic\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and social interaction.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Lujain Ibrahim [view email]**[v1]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 15:33:20 UTC (1,073 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:11:59 UTC (1,071 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Rote Learning Considered Useful: Generalizing over Memorized Data in LLMs\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8 LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured, semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations. Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within news article.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.SI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost, fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:AutoTIR: Autonomous Tools Integrated Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid, predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence. Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness, structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at this https URL.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, even though researchers have proposed different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single variables (${\\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two variables (${\\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable prompts for each coding task and model.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic, balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:The Problem with Safety Classification is not just the Models\n\nView PDFAbstract:Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue. Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves, there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

To mitigate this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29 subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios: memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data. The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments, providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167 open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy, underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at this https URL.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Existing SFT-based safety alignment studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs. To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of correction-based supervision.

However, current reward models underperform in challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations: 1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and 2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark (Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application, and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with unlabeled data.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Building on the state-of-the-art monolingual JobBERT-V2, our approach extends support to English, German, Spanish, and Chinese by leveraging synthetic translations and a balanced multilingual dataset of over 21 million job titles. The model retains the efficiency-focused architecture of its predecessor while enabling robust alignment across languages without requiring task-specific supervision. Extensive evaluations on the TalentCLEF 2025 benchmark demonstrate that JobBERT-V3 outperforms strong multilingual baselines and achieves consistent performance across both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. While not the primary focus, we also show that the model can be effectively used to rank relevant skills for a given job title, demonstrating its broader applicability in multilingual labor market intelligence.

We argue that the teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student, beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness. This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender bias amplification often associated with KD.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Aarón Galiano-Jiménez [view email]**[v1]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 07:59:20 UTC (6,521 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Using the same analytical framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao [view email]**[v1]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 07:40:32 UTC (543 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Existing benchmarks for investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions. Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26 subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures. Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Automatic Classification of User Requirements from Online Feedback -- A Replication Study\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation, it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient, machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline), \"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset Environments using Deep Learning\", which evaluated different deep learning models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models. Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and support the replication of our study.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Existing static sparse attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup, e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to enhance LLM inference efficiency.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Model-free Speculative Decoding for Transformer-based ASR with Token Map Drafting\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \\emph{Token Map Drafting}, a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model. Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\\times$ on the CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\\%$ absolute improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU, highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language Models\n\nView PDFAbstract:Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41 datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings. In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in embedding tasks.

In this paper, we address the label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\\% increase in MMLU score). Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\\%.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Probing Non-STEM Reasoning Abilities with HumorBench\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately 300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and this http URL, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor reasoning.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Towards Locally Deployable Fine-Tuned Causal Large Language Models for Mode Choice Behaviour\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task. We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning, this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and broadening access through local deployment.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, fixed context windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated, independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1) Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode, combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100 consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average), while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "title": "ReGATE: Learning Faster and Better with Fewer Tokens in MLLMs",
    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:ReGATE: Learning Faster and Better with Fewer Tokens in MLLMs\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden representations. In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Shijie Zhou [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 23:52:53 UTC (2,491 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 04:49:38 UTC (2,498 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Teaching Language Models To Gather Information Proactively\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex, ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings, defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements -- that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Turbocharging Web Automation: The Impact of Compressed History States\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline approach without history inputs.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage ``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source, we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a) LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b) objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination, they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably, models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline extraction systems, to support continued research.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Satyananda Kashyap [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 21:20:44 UTC (788 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

The research aimed to address the challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers worldwide.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Leslie Wellington Sirora [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 20:57:26 UTC (496 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, persistent concerns about embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives. Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical alignment.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Can human clinical rationales improve the performance and explainability of clinical text classification models?\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649 electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority, training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale coverage) compared to training on additional reports.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Drahomira Herrmannova [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 19:44:25 UTC (980 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training, paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production environments.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they \"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: David Maria Schmidt [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 18:20:41 UTC (224 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

It is difficult to identify hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the door to further improvements in this area.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and costly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet, to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

We examine how different aspects of the fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data, using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.\n\nOur research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning.\n\nKey findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3) Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns at higher ranks.\n\nThese results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large language models while managing data privacy concerns.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different \"subregions\" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nq-fin.PM\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings, we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and even maintains or improves quality.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Using activation patching, we take a first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and color-based identities.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This work presents an effective approach for detecting and editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8% improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2% drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of large language models across diverse applications beyond finance.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:FHSTP@EXIST 2025 Benchmark: Sexism Detection with Transparent Speech Concept Bottleneck Models\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks (EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask 1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks. SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles, can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and Spanish and 6th for Spanish.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Adrian Jaques Böck MSc [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 15:30:17 UTC (41 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

MediQAl contains 32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii) Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with 14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025 (v1), last revised 29 Jul 2025 (this version, v2)]\n\n# Title:Soft Injection of Task Embeddings Outperforms Prompt-Based In-Context Learning\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters. This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.2%-14.3% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones -- underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the activation space.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jungwon Park [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 14:59:17 UTC (758 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 02:15:56 UTC (758 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with Attention-Guided Refinement\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations. Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose $A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework, enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset, Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$ significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core components during inference.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

State-of-the-art methods use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.\n\nTo address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world projects.\n\nExperiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by 22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match by 35.55%.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

In this work, we systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes, mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Dinh Nam Pham [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 14:36:46 UTC (4,828 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:27:34 UTC (4,828 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed \\texttt{llm\\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models, Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results, while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This is due to various motivations like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from the past 6 years, with \"diversity\" or \"diverse\" in their title. We find a wide range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why, what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3 dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between various approaches.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Previous work focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues, we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Automating Thematic Review of Prevention of Future Deaths Reports: Replicating the ONS Child Suicide Study using Large Language Models\n\nView PDFAbstract:Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\\leq$ 18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully automated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit) could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72 child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's $\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:On The Role of Pretrained Language Models in General-Purpose Text Embeddings: A Survey\n\nView PDFAbstract:Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives, and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines, including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based approaches.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Investigating Structural Pruning and Recovery Techniques for Compressing Multimodal Large Language Models: An Empirical Study\n\nView PDFAbstract:While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs), but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training. Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training, finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance. Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or sufficient data.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Text2VLM: Adapting Text-Only Datasets to Evaluate Alignment Training in Visual Language Models\n\nView PDFAbstract:The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated. To address this gap, we propose \\textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities, Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse, real-world applications.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While large language models have shown remarkable capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo) using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of 16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art (41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior, including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Hanna Shcharbakova [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 10:49:04 UTC (1,921 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards, which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e., the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO. Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K.

However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB prediction.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Anais ollagnier [view email] [via CCSD proxy]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 08:27:58 UTC (1,059 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Our zero-shot approach requires no finetuning on the competition's data. For retrieval, we ensemble similarity scores from CLIP, SigLIP, and DINOv2. For captioning, we leverage a carefully engineered prompt to guide the Gemma 3 model, enabling it to link high-level events from the article to the visual content in the image. Our system achieved a final score of 0.42002, securing a top-4 position on the private test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining foundation models through ensembling and prompting.

As users increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.\n\nKimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, the development of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of difficult, novel training data. We introduce \\textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \\textbf{Difficulty Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by \\textbf{$\\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\\% to 49.23\\%. The full generation pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs. SAND-Math dataset is released here: \\href{this https URL}{this https URL}\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Prakamya Mishra [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 05:17:48 UTC (3,394 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:02:27 UTC (3,395 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Security Challenges in AI Agent Deployment: Insights from a Large Scale Public Competition\n\nView PDFAbstract:Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming (ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across 19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent deployment.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:AQUA: A Large Language Model for Aquaculture & Fisheries\n\nView PDFAbstract:Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks, inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies, and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Praneeth Narisetty [view email]**[v1]**Mon, 28 Jul 2025 05:06:07 UTC (689 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Machine Learning\n\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Customize Multi-modal RAI Guardrails with Precedent-based predictions\n\nView PDFAbstract:A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation. Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy. Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies, restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's judgment on \"precedents\", which are the reasoning processes of prior data points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law, users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating natural language into formal logic representations.\n\nTo address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.\n\nEmpirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:CodeNER: Code Prompting for Named Entity Recognition\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition (NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: \"Why do not we have an evaluation standard for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?\" similar to ISO standard in industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Khloud Al Jallad [view email]**[v1]**Sun, 27 Jul 2025 21:30:50 UTC (1,146 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language, reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

In visual tasks grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\\% on average).

Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output length without any external control.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Evaluating these capabilities is becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a \\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \\textbf{user-centric} bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000 dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All code and datasets will be released soon.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

The model builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation. DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal, glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education and speech therapy.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Advancing Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic Machine Translation\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian, and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over 10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than 1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Abdullah Alabdullah [view email]**[v1]**Sun, 27 Jul 2025 14:37:53 UTC (1,168 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in tool automation, they struggle to seamlessly integrate and orchestrate multiple tools for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present SciToolAgent, an LLM-powered agent that automates hundreds of scientific tools across biology, chemistry, and materials science. At its core, SciToolAgent leverages a scientific tool knowledge graph that enables intelligent tool selection and execution through graph-based retrieval-augmented generation. The agent also incorporates a comprehensive safety-checking module to ensure responsible and ethical tool usage. Extensive evaluations on a curated benchmark demonstrate that SciToolAgent significantly outperforms existing approaches. Case studies in protein engineering, chemical reactivity prediction, chemical synthesis, and metal-organic framework screening further demonstrate SciToolAgent's capability to automate complex scientific workflows, making advanced research tools accessible to both experts and non-experts.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

How Multilinguality Affects Internal Language Representations\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed, cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one; and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer research.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Katharina Trinley [view email]**[v1]**Sun, 27 Jul 2025 13:53:45 UTC (12,000 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:MoL-RL: Distilling Multi-Step Environmental Feedback into LLMs for Feedback-Independent Reasoning\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training, which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss) and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence), with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation (CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities in diverse domains.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:EMBRACE: Shaping Inclusive Opinion Representation by Aligning Implicit Conversations with Social Norms\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair participation and reflections of values is at the core of many conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i) positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii) instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Post-Completion Learning for Language Models\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.\n\nTo fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve multi-objective hybrid optimization.\n\nExperimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while preserving deployment efficiency.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This paper investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured through linguistically grounded modeling.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations, leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations, Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing interpretability for transformer-based text classification.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking \"Innovative Moments\" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and 230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social applications.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

A central challenge is to effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences. Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g., titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at this https URL.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ, or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model selection, and profile models along each latent skill.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Diversity-Enhanced Reasoning for Subjective Questions\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced training in LRMs.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

For example, if an user clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and model customer intention effectively because insufficient information exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark, SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention enhances LLMs' performances.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline self-improving methods without using external preference data.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While current Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking (UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework for developing goal-aligned user simulators.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, it often produces brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how stability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism. We also prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI systems.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation, which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have shown that our generated English and Arabic questions (\\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in this https URL.

The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

Traditionally, discovering these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets. Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others, achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Machine Learning\n\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:MaPPO: Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization with Prior Knowledge\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025 (v1), last revised 29 Jul 2025 (this version, v2)]\n\n# Title:Sem-DPO: Mitigating Semantic Inconsistency in Preference Optimization for Prompt Engineering\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.\n\nWe introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss using a weight based on how different the winning prompt is from the original, reducing the impact of training examples that are semantically misaligned. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language models.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Azal Ahmad Khan [view email]**[v1]**Sun, 27 Jul 2025 05:20:13 UTC (10,692 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 04:18:09 UTC (10,693 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

We present a scalable framework that uses advanced large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts, addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English) and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU, METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of cultural preservation.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Rodrigo Gabriel Salazar Alva [view email]**[v1]**Sun, 27 Jul 2025 03:29:19 UTC (231 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

One key desirable capability for speech language models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long contexts.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Abdelrahman Mohamed [view email]**[v1]**Sat, 26 Jul 2025 23:00:43 UTC (1,048 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Recent post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation, eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Sarat Chandra Bobbili [view email]**[v1]**Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:46:32 UTC (800 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While RAG demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic, diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models, rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous knowledge sources.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:A Tensor-Based Compiler and a Runtime for Neuron-Level DNN Certifier Specifications\n\nView PDFAbstract:The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n\nWe propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.\n\nUsing our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Using a more realistic online evaluation protocol, $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art (AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforming baselines by large margins while being orders of magnitude faster, with training under 4 seconds and inference as low as 4 $\\mu$s.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Infogen: Generating Complex Statistical Infographics from Documents\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI, particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical infographic generation.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:FAEDKV: Infinite-Window Fourier Transform for Unbiased KV Cache Compression\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel, training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by up to 22\\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based approaches.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Anomalies in language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19 fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral 7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Sayed Mahbub Hasan Amiri [view email]**[v1]**Sat, 26 Jul 2025 17:21:11 UTC (514 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 05:18:46 UTC (524 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CY\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Leveraging LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The need for building legal text processing applications for different natural languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal information retrieval and question-answering tasks.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Information Retrieval\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Improving the Performance of Sequential Recommendation Systems with an Extended Large Language Model\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\\%, 8.69\\%, and 8.19\\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current recommendation systems.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.IR\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use. Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions, particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Dan Song [view email]**[v1]**Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:33:05 UTC (689 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 15:46:47 UTC (687 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Leveraging Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Interpretable Pancreatic Cystic Lesion Feature Extraction and Risk Categorization\n\nView PDFAbstract:Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models (LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134 patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79% to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved (LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns, and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges, and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26% to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer correctness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart accuracy.

In this work, we propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights. KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence. Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality. The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Rina Tse [view email]**[v1]**Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:24:02 UTC (1,365 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Wed, 30 Jul 2025 13:52:22 UTC (1,365 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.RO\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks (i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder, Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning, full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking performance of various models due to different data distributions and overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.\n\nKeywords: large language models, automated program repair, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, AI4Code, AI4SE, ML4SE.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.SE\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:CaliDrop: KV Cache Compression with Calibration\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques, including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{CaliDrop}, a novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential biases in their performance across different languages.\n\nThis study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo, LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet, and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of the generated explanations.\n\nThe results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates, performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities, emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for non-English medical AI applications.\n\nOur findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies, improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven medical assistance.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Yet, existing datasets fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts, repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage, prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource, enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4 improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1 improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38, METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10 percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness (3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Machine Learning\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models' intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions.

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:AutoSign: Direct Pose-to-Text Translation for Continuous Sign Language Recognition\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text, bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences, followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR. By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to 6.1\\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%. Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:Flora: Effortless Context Construction to Arbitrary Length and Scale\n\nView PDFAbstract:Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context tasks.

However, traditional RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with 128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\\% to 85.1\\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\\% to 61.9\\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the community.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Lightweight Narrative Annotation of Christian Fiction with LMs\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for \"acts of God.\" We then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Rebecca M.

While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework. Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL) method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on competition-level mathematics.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

Distillation is one technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for small models on generic texts that are \\emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Xiangyu Duan [view email]**[v1]**Sat, 26 Jul 2025 02:11:55 UTC (3,474 KB)\n\n**[v2]**Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:51:15 UTC (3,474 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

However, generating text that incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2) aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5 and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

This work benchmarking the performance of multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic, English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2. We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Payam Jome Yazdian [view email]**[v1]**Fri, 25 Jul 2025 21:33:48 UTC (4,832 KB)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*\nIArxiv Recommender\n\n*(What is IArxiv?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:RoD-TAL: A Benchmark for Answering Questions in Romanian Driving License Exams\n\nView PDFAbstract:The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks. To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance. At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Răzvan-Alexandru Smădu [view email]**[v1]**Fri, 25 Jul 2025 20:40:39 UTC (651 KB)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Cryptography and Security\n\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:OneShield -- the Next Generation of LLM Guardrails\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature of LLMs makes the task of universally shielding users against their potential risks extremely challenging, and one-size-fits-all solutions unfeasible. In this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first deployment.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

    "abstract": "# Computer Science > Computation and Language\n\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\n\n# Title:MCIF: Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction-Following Benchmark from Scientific Talks\n\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities--speech, vision, and text--and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",

To enhance translation quality in this low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions. Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently adheres to the required CoT output format.\n\n### References & Citations\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer\n\n*(What is the Explorer?)*\nConnected Papers\n\n*(What is Connected Papers?)*\nLitmaps\n\n*(What is Litmaps?)*\nscite Smart Citations\n\n*(What are Smart Citations?)*# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv\n\n*(What is alphaXiv?)*\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n\n*(What is CatalyzeX?)*\nDagsHub\n\n*(What is DagsHub?)*\nGotit.pub\n\n*(What is GotitPub?)*\nHugging Face\n\n*(What is Huggingface?)*\nPapers with Code\n\n*(What is Papers with Code?)*\nScienceCast\n\n*(What is ScienceCast?)*# Demos\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower\n\n*(What are Influence Flowers?)*\nCORE Recommender\n\n*(What is CORE?)*# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community? **Learn more about arXivLabs**.",
